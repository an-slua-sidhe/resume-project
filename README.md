# MY RESUME

## A Bootstrap 4 mini-project

#### In this mini-project, I combine the skills I have learned in HTML and CSS Fundamentals with those learned in User Centric Front-end.
#### The end goal is a fully functioning webpage showing off my skills as a budding programer.
#### This mini-project is a precursor to the first Mile-stone Project of the course.

#### I will be using a combination of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create the webpage.
#### Javascript elements will be introduced using Bootstrap.
#### A full commit history will be available on Github.

#### I hope this project and it's code is legible and interesting!
