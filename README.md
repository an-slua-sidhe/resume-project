# MY RESUME

## A Bootstrap 4 mini-project

#### This code is for a personal Resume/CV site.
#### The website is a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
#### I use Bootstrap to create the site's structure.
#### A full commit history is available on Github.

#### I created the site as part of my Diploma in Full-stack Web Development, which I undertoook at the Code Inistitute, Dublin.
#### Here I combined the skills I learned in HTML and CSS Fundamentals with those I obtained in User Centric Front-end.
#### The end goal was a fully functioning webpage, showing off my skills as a budding programer.
#### This mini-project was a precursor to the first Mile-stone Project of the course.
#### After completing Milestone 1, along with modules on Javascript Fundamentals and Interactive Frontend Development, 
#### I returned here to add Javascript functionality to the code; namely, EmailJS.

#### I hope this project and it's code is legible and interesting!
